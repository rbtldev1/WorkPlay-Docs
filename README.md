## Specific concepts

### How to use WorkPlay ?

If you're working on a high-focus task in your work day routine, you can enter the [Focus](#focus) room at WorkPlay. This room is generally quieter and gives you an opportunity to interact with people who are working on high-focus tasks.

if you're having a light work day, you can enter the [Lobby](#lobby) room at WorkPlay. This room has an interesting dynamic during the day and facilitates not just simple interaction but also songs, poems and other talent by voice.
This is the default chill room here at WorkPlay.

If you're interested in only specific topics and want to gather opinions of the members at WorkPlay, you can use either the [Opinion](#opinion) or [Discussion](#discussion) room to do so.

Opinion rooms will help you get perspective from various members on a specific topic or question.

Discussion rooms add an additional layer of a healthy back & forth discussion on the responses to the specific topic or question.

### What kind of rooms exist at WorkPlay ?

There are 4 main types of rooms at WorkPlay:

#### Lobby

Multiple lobby's can run simultaneously.
The first 2 [mods](#mods) generally decide the conduct of the lobby.

#### Focus
